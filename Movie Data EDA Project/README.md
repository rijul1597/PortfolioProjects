# Movie Data EDA Project

This project explores a dataset of movies with features such as rating, genre, budget and gross revenue. The analysis is performed in the Jupyter notebook `MovieIndustryDataset EDA and Correlation Portfolio Project.ipynb` and includes cleaning steps, exploratory plots and investigation of feature correlations.

## Dataset

The CSV file `movies.csv` is included in this folder. It was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets). To use the notebook, keep the CSV in the same directory so that it can be loaded with a relative path.

## Running the notebook

1. Install the required Python packages (for example using `pip install -r requirements.txt`).
2. Start Jupyter and open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "MovieIndustryDataset EDA and Correlation Portfolio Project.ipynb"
   ```
3. Run the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.

The notebook has been cleaned to remove duplicate outputs and uses relative file paths so it should run on any machine.
