# COVID-19 Data Exploration

This folder contains a SQL script with queries analyzing global COVID-19 cases and vaccinations. The script expects two tables, `CovidDeaths` and `CovidVaccinations`, in the `PortfolioProject` database.

The raw datasets are not included in this repository. Download them from a reputable source (such as [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)) and load them into your database before running the script.
